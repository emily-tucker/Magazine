     <h2><a id="C23">Cardinal Red</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Tessa Lindahl</i></h3>
	<p>
Can’t you see the noises and tell me what color the word Thursday is?<br />
Its green.<br />
An emerald green.<br />
I don’t like Thursdays but the color I can deal with.<br /> 
Mondays are nasty and yellow but not the kind of yellow that little kids color the sun to be or sunflower yellow or corn yellow or even road paint yellow.<br />
Its a mustard color.<br />
Like the gas, not the condiment.<br />
It’s ugly and frustrating.<br />
<br />
Some people have colors in their names. <br />
My mother’s is a lilac color.<br />
My brother’s is the color of a salmon’s belly.<br />
My best friend has an E in his name that is always purple.<br />
But there is one name that comes to mind that I don’t like.<br />
It’s a cardinal red that is beautiful and entrancing and almost as obnoxious as an ugly Christmas sweater and stoic and happy and angry and monumental. <br />
It’s not that I don’t like the color, it’s that I have feelings attached to that certain name and now that certain hue that I will never get out of my head or out of my life and I will see it every day for as long as I remember because it is as unforgettable as soaking in gasoline fumes and stars.<br />
<br />
If I try really hard, I don’t always see the colors of the words. <br />
I can be normal for split seconds of time but then I go back to seeing the mess of everything in my head. <br />
Cardinal red used me feel normal. <br />
He made me feel like the blood coursing through my veins wasn’t candy colored and my mind wasn’t painted with abominable stripes.<br />
And I hate cardinal red now because the name attached to it showed me that normality for me will always be an illusion.<br />
An illusion filled with mustard colored Mondays and emerald Thursdays and purple colored E’s that don’t make sense because I know that all of these words are written with black ink and only I can see the fucking colors that don’t mix well and turn into a botched piece of brown art when they get jumbled.<br />
Cardinal red has completely fucked me over.<br />
It’s a good thing not many people have that color in their name.<br />

        <h2><a id="C24">Light and Dark</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Donielle Carr</i></h3> 

<p>
It’s like when you’re standing on a precipice, <br />
And the clouds appear dark and foreboding.<br />
Cold sweeps up through the valley,<br />
And an icy chill clutches your chest.<br />
<br />
The view is spectacular,<br />
The feeling mute.<br />
A stream of light bursts forth from cloud,<br />
Illuminating the majestic Red Lady.<br />
<br />
There is a veracity in its light,<br />
A beauty that beckons.<br />
<br />
For when you are in the light, it is blinding,<br />
The darkness becomes consumed and appears to be no more.<br />
When you are in the light, it is everything,<br />
Your being becomes enveloped by the warm glow that draws you in.<br />
<br />
But the sun shall not shine forever,<br />
Balance is needed, an accord between the light and dark.<br />
<br />
Where there was once a brilliant streak of sunshine,<br />
There is now only shadow.<br />
Though it is shadow that implies the sun still remains,<br />
Merely hidden from sight.<br />
<br />
I turn my back on the darkness enfolding, <br />
Only to realize that I have it surrounding,<br />
And that it too has a blinding effect.<br />
<br />
I walk on.<br />
<br />
Within certain glances <br />
There are sunspots still visible before my eyes,<br />
A transparency over the gloomy shade.<br />
Haunting, like a memory.<br />
<br />
It keeps you going while holding you back,<br />
As these sunspots are remnants,<br />
Visions of the past.<br />
<br />
Look to the future,<br />
Where the sun will rise again.<br />
<br />
<br />

        <h3><i>Donielle Carr</i></h3>
	<p>
Suspended,<br />
in thought<br />
I recounted my dream.<br />
<br />
Searching,<br />
hidden meanings<br />
that become clear<br />
just outside<br />
the peripheral of light.<br />
<br />
Concentrated,<br />
with narrow focus <br />
the spotlight spectrum <br />
becomes minute.<br />
I step back to grasp<br />
the knowledge within sight.<br />
<br />
Entranced,<br />
I widen the scope <br />
of my lens,<br />
<br />
Seeking,<br />
enlightenment<br />
on a broader scale.<br />
<br />
Exposing,<br />
crevices<br />
where existed <br />
thought-provoking dens,<br />
mysteries laying just beyond the veil.<br />

        <h2><a id="C2">Desolation Canyon</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Anna Boyle</i></h3> 

<p>
Coffee digs between my teeth grounds grinding<br />
A corpse within my sleeping bag, <br />
I rise from the morning, mummified,<br />
confined to a transient dawn <br />
The light soft, settled<br />
rising above timberline. <br />
Dew sticks along morning<br />
condensation between breaths<br />
between breaths, breathing.<br />
Ascending, exhaling, the river<br />
awaits reflecting time <br />
of the preparatory time reflected.<br /> 
Canyon walls succumbed to carving waters,<br />
awakened by the dawn lets me announce myself<br />
ruing the fate, unforgiving <br />
to the last waves of the river bed. <br />

        <h3><i>Samuel Lesnikoski</i></h3>
<p>
A psychedelic symphony of sonic sight<br />
A cacophony of luminous crashes<br />
Yet no sound<br />
Friction of humidity<br />
And jagged clouds<br />
 <br />
Sends a flint spark of light<br />
Across the sky<br />
 <br />
Balls of white heat<br />
Free energy flowing through<br />
The heavy hanging<br />
Humidity clouds<br />
 <br />
Des Moines heat lightening <br />
 <br />
Waves of petrified sand<br />
Sifted high <br />
By the long forgotten<br />
Yet omnipresent<br />
Winds of time<br />
 <br />
Scraggly green grasses<br />
and yellow sage tips<br />
Brush in wind<br />
A rustle in the understory<br />
In the wake of prairie dog<br />
 <br />
Nebraska Contours<br />
 <br />
In Santa Fe<br />
Red racer two foot long<br />
Lies on the side of the house<br />
In mound of dead dry leaves<br />
And shakes its tail<br />
RATTLING<br /> 
A sonic chameleon <br />
 <br />
Red sandstone dust <br />
Encrusts rusted pickup truck bumper;<br />
The slough off of<br />
Frozen blocks of the desert. <br />
 <br />
While in Colorado <br />
Circular swaths of yellow aspens<br />
Stand as<br />
Gold doubloons<br />
On the hillside<br />
 <br />
South West by North East<br />
 <br />
In Gunnison rivers sink<br />
And snow flies<br />
 <br />
In Vermont leaves fall<br />
And barns rise<br />
 <br />
South West by North East <br />

<h2><a id="C4">Eyebeam Magic</a></h2>
<h3><i>Haley Pearsall</i></h3>

<p>
Is the cause of fire<br />
The cause of light?<br />
Is the effect Separate<br />
From what is the cause?<br />
Is existence nothing more<br />
Than vision, perception,<br />
Cause of sight,<br />
Treasure to light?<br />
For where is beauty<br />
Without one to behold it?<br />
 <br />
Fire is but a vessel<br />
That animates light<br />
And the light exists<br />
With the fire, is fire<br />
Which is a continuation<br />
Of the original cause<br />
Perhaps consciousness<br />
Accompanies existence<br />
Like light with fire.<br />
It is a vain thought<br />
That the universe<br />
Was made for you,<br />
But does one exist<br />
Without the other?<br />
 <br />
Yes, before man,<br />
Divine human life<br />
And other creatures<br />
Conscious and living,<br />
There was nothing,<br />
The universe was cold<br />
Vast and empty<br />
Until life evolved;<br />
It inspires belief<br />
That existence,<br />
By nature, that matter<br />
And energy, the basis<br />
For life, had to manifest<br />
In living forms, and beauty<br />
Embodied in many entities<br />
One of which was man<br />
To witness this miracle<br />
To understand the patterns:<br />
The flaming constellations<br />
The electron bacteria flagella<br />
The continuous sequences<br />
Of the human genome,<br />
The Fibonacci sequence,<br />
Pi, the infinite answer<br />
To this circular world<br />
This continuation,<br />
Yet if this is endlessness,<br />
What will become<br />
Of worldly consciousness,<br />
And what is this<br />
You call the Original Cause?<br />
 
It is the greatest mystery<br />
These two questions<br />
Asked by saints and sages:<br />
From whence and whereto?<br />
Inquired throughout ages<br />
And the generations<br />
That have come and gone<br />
Perhaps came to know<br />
But we the living<br />
Singing this song<br />
In physical realms below<br />
See past what is color<br />
When the world of light<br />
Seen only in black and white<br />
There surreal spirits hide<br />
Hidden from the mortal eye<br />
May the secrets be revealed<br />
When the power behind <br />
The eye is unbound<br />
And dances freely<br />
The magical eyebeam<br />
The light behind matter<br />
Is released and everything<br />
The impermanence:<br />
Fickle matter and objects<br />
Pass away…it is here<br />
The Original Cause<br />
May be understood<br />
And the lightbeam<br />
Of the immortal soul<br />
That lingers behind eyes<br />
Continues<br />
The circle<br />
The pattern<br />
The worldly consciousness<br />
Becomes universal<br />
And as humans dwindle<br />
In stages of being<br />
Between ignorance<br />
And impeccable bliss<br />
Life begins to guess<br />
And inquire to know<br />
What is the divine power<br />
The force that began<br />
The tumultuous flow<br />
That continues forever<br />
What is the original cause<br />
And what is god<br />
<br />

<h3><i>Donielle Carr</i></h3>

<p>
The stark arid landscape expands beneath<br />
The horizon with its light twice as bright,<br />
As two fading suns cast a blood orange sky.<br />
The binary beauty of a system<br />
Explored by an extrasolar planet.<br />
<br />
Heat meets the cool terrestrial surface.<br />
A thin veil of fog sweeps the ground below,<br />
Rising up from a molecular mix<br />
Of elemental temperature change,<br />
Glowing in a mysterious matter.<br />
<br />
In my mind, we are not light-years apart.<br />
Protected by our spacesuits, we huddle<br />
Close together as the double sun sets.<br />

<h2><a id="C6">Midnight Vanilla with Light Moisturizers </a></h2>
<h3><i>Frederick Slyter</i></h3>

<p>
As life evolves,<br />
more and more<br />
of my dreams<br />
die. I now know<br />
I’ll never be<br />
a knight, a wizard, <br />
a time-traveler.<br />
I won’t visit other planets,<br />
speak to animals,<br />
or fly unassisted.<br />
To cope, to deal,<br />
to drink these sorrows<br />
away, another dream<br />
dies. I cannot find<br />
a quiet pub,<br />
a dark Blues room<br />
or a cocktail café<br />
That hasn’t been modernized<br />
into a smoke-free, spit-free, McCafé<br />
without sawdust<br />
on the floor<br />
or peanut shells<br />
on the bar.<br />
Every time I leave<br />
the men’s room<br />
my hands smell<br />
like Midnight Vanilla<br />
With Light Moisturizers.<br />
This is exactly <br />
what’s wrong with the world today.<br />

<h2><a id="C7">November</a></h2>
<h3><i>Holly Rios</i></h3>

<p>

Every year, Ferlinghetti asks me, <br />
	“Who are we now?”<br />
I still do not know how to answer that.<br />
		Mostly because I still do not know. <br />
		Every year, late fall, in the crisp cool decay, I remember<br />
					people getting divorced.<br />
   I ask, <br />
        Ferlinghetti, did you ever split your own seams?<br />
		Or did you remain intact?<br />
		Late November at age 19<br />
I drank vodka in the Minneapolis cold<br />
	with a homeless stranger<br />
		who remorsefully <br />
	     offered me the bottle at a bus stop<br />
	       as if it were rude to drink without <br />
					me.<br />
And I wanted to ask him,<br />
	Do you think that people can bust themselves at the seams?<br />
		Do you think that people can sew themselves back together?<br />
On that Thursday, I drank too much white wine,<br />
		and contemplated Ferlinghetti. <br />
				I wonder if I ought to resole my boots. <br />
		I wonder if I should try to fix what is already there,<br />
				though it’s worn down.<br />
Wine hazed, wondering,<br />
	if you still think I feel like home <br />
when it’s hard for me to even hold a conversation or <br />
			remember to brush my teeth.<br />
I wonder if<br />
<br />
					you still want to be my heel, my traction.<br />
<br />

<h2><a id="C8">People Are As So</a></h2>
<h3><i>Marlena Romero</i></h3>

<p>
There stands a boy <br />
and there stands a girl. <br />
There stands a phrase: <br />
“What did I do to deserve<br />
you?” A bad boy beckons<br />
a good girl giddy with glee.<br />
<br />
He locks her eyes in the tinted<br />
windows of his soul, tickling<br />
her yearning of the words she dreams<br />
of hearing. The phrase is voiced.<br />
<br />
She locks his eyes and her <br />
windows begin to tint a blind-<br />
sided black. The good girl<br />
is grungy, deceiving, light<br />
out for people to keep<br />
from judging what is dark.<br />
The bad boy is beautiful, bodacious,<br />
a tough attitude to keep<br />
people from seeing just how much <br />
he does care. <br />
<br />
Bad karma to bad people <br />
and good karma to the good. Bad<br />
people are bad karma and good<br />
people keep secrets.<br />
Good people are good karma<br />
and bad people want<br />
to be burned.<br />
<br />
Hopeless are the secrets, useful <br />
are the lies, dangerous <br />
are the truths, all held below. <br />

<h2><a id="C9">Sleep Paralysis</a></h2>
<h3><i>Mason Brainard</i></h3>

<p>
A jolt of electricity rushes through my body like an ocean wave, my bones feel heavy, full of lead. I gasp for breath as cold pale hands squeeze tighter around my neck. Everything is black, it is as if I am floating in an abyss of endless nothingness. It feels like I’ve been drugged: my head spins, my eyes water, my nerves tingle. When I finally open my eyes a knot of fire explodes in my chest as I realize, my attacker, this monster, is me. <br />
<br />
She has MY face, MY body, MY hands that are around MY neck. But her eyes are not mine, they are not hazel with hints of green and gold, they are black lifeless pits staring back at me. Laughing, knowing that she’s got the best of me, that she is winning.<br />
<br />
I grab the hands around my throat and pull, kick, scratch, anything to get her off of me, to breathe, to escape this evil. <br />
<br />
Why is she doing this to me? <br />
Who is this devil version of myself?<br />
Is this the real me…?<br />
<br />
And if it is, why is she stronger than me? More powerful, more motivated, more beautiful than I could ever dream to be. She is killing me. Taking over every hair, every freckle, every molecule that is me. And filling them with her. <br />
<br />
I am about to lose it. The oxygen leaves my lungs, black spots cloud the edges of my vision, and my own hands go limp. She has won.<br />
<br />
Then I feel my eyes open, the black spots clear, I take violent deep breaths, trying to regain the feeling in my body. I look in the mirror and see my hazel green eyes again. But something is different, I almost miss the girl I saw a few moments ago, I almost want her back. <br />

    <h2><a id="C10">Taking Over</a></h2>
	<h3><i>Marlena Romero</i></h3>

<p> 
Breathing in that untouched,<br />
clean air. I don’t like it. Your breathing,<br />
in a warm bed, it’s too warm –<br />
“Mama, I don’t feel well.”— Soon<br />
you will feel everything, I want you<br />
to feel all that pain I have to share.<br />
Doctors know nothing! They blame your mind, <br />
but doctors know nothing. –“I’m not crazy, Mama!”—<br />
You’re so easy to wear down. Everyone looks so sad <br />
about you. You’re finished, unworthy, it’s my time!<br />
DO NOT FLINCH AT THAT, THAT IS NOT PAIN!<br />
You want to curl into a ball, why don’t I twist <br />
our torso opposite our legs. And raise those legs.—<br />
“What a slut. What a slut. What a slut.<br />
Such a slut. Mama, your girl hasn’t been a virgin in years. Slut!”—<br />
Suspended for throwing another girl <br />
against the lockers. Now you are home for me <br />
to beat you away. I need more space for my stay.<br />
A psychotic child: it’s how the doctors diagnosed us,<br />
not normal teenage behavior, the violence, vulgar outbursts;<br />
Schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome,			NO!<br />
Wrinkles are covering Mama’s face now: I have defeated her, too.<br />
Did you see that Mama? I made<br />
your baby fly and now she’s sticking on the wall—<br />
“A priest? For me? Mama, you shouldn’t have!”—<br />
Doctors knew nothing, the priest will know less. No religion<br />
can be on your side so long as I’m in charge.—<br />
“The crucifix will not save her!”— Lick it, and slide it on the slut.—<br />
“Burn me with the holy water! Ahhhhh! It burns so nice!<br />
You can’t have her back! Mine, mine, mine, my slutty tart!”—<br />
I will whisper for Mama –“Your tart is gone, I have taken over, <br />
I have taken over, I have taken over”—<br />
She’s trying to hold us, but instead let’s bend back over her arms.—<br />
“Hey, priesty, priesty, priesty! <br />
I took her, ego tuli eam, I took her!<br />
You cannot have her back, you cannot have her, vos non potesis habere eam!”— <br />

<h3><i>Madison Manning</i></h3> 
<p>

Time is now incomprehensible<br />
Nonexistent is mercy for mistakes<br />
Perpetual struggle, punishment for battle<br />
Various pressures and strains, source the anxiety<br />
The excruciating pain builds between the sculpted blades<br />
Numbed by an unbearable ache, external, internal, agony eternal<br />
Multi-dimensional tension is unreservedly strung throughout the axis <br /> 
The mind vanishes, omitting notions of pleasure, desperate for the bolt’s relief<br />
Heavens shriek, Love once enduring, cries its concluding call, mortal essence dissolves.<br />
Atlas finally falls.<br />

<h2><a id="C12">The Box in the Attic</a></h2>
<h3><i>Mason Brainard</i></h3> 

<p>
I walk up the creaking stairs, dust <br />
filling my lungs. There are wardrobes <br />
and trunks, and pictures of dead guys, <br />
their eyes follow my every move.<br />
<br />
A box catches my baby toe, arousing <br />
my curiosity. The box is old, but it comes alive<br />
in my hands, begging to be opened. <br />
<br />
Cold air burns my eyes, revealing<br />
a hunting jacket and a handgun. <br />
I know there is a secret here,<br />
<br />
one that I <br />
am not supposed to know. <br />
<br />
The box is evil. Filled to the tipping point of <br />
sin.<br />
<br />
A photograph of a couple <br />
of young killers smiling runs chills down my back. <br />
They are happy, laughing with no remorse for <br />
what they’ve done. <br />
<br />
Old wives tales creep into my memory, <br />
they are why my grandmother could not go out at night<br />
when she was young. <br />
<br />
The boy is long gone, shot between <br />
the shoulder blades, in a dark empty lot, <br />
somewhere in Virginia. His dark curls matted <br />
with dirt. <br />
<br />
The gun is rusty, I feel its power<br />
as I hold it against my heart, <br />
calling me to his unfinished business. <br />
<br />
Don’t tell my grandmother…<br />
but he likes me. Tells me<br />
I’m beautiful, <br />

<p>
The time came<br />
when my journeys<br />
surrendered me to Carcosa. <br />
<br />
That timeless city,<br />
where black stars <br />
gleamed above<br />
nightshade meadows,<br />
and fragrant flowers<br />
bled their sickening <br />
sweet pulp until it dripped down<br />
to form the Lake of Hali below.<br />
<br />
That sobering city,<br />
where twin moons flanked<br />
folding reflections<br />
as their shapes rippled<br />
across Hali’s surface,<br />
until the skyline collapsed <br />
inward into the cosmic dusk.<br />
<br />
For some time I was sure <br />
I must be trapped there,<br />
in that city <br />
that never wakes,<br />
whose jagged towers pointed <br />
like frail fingers up <br />
toward Hyades and across<br />
forgotten galaxies.<br />
<br />
I lost part of myself<br />
there, in Carcosa,<br />
where the shadows <br />
lengthened into days, <br />
and the sultry air <br />
turned every living thing <br />
into stone.  <br />

<h2><a id="C14">The Vortex of Gold Hill</a></h2>
<h3><i>Donielle Carr</i></h3>
<p>
A spherical field of force<br />
creates a whirling mass,<br />
the basic form of our universe.<br />
<br />
Where the ground was once forbidden,<br />
a shack now sits, dubbed: <br />
The House of Mystery.<br />
<br />
A door was drawn, <br />
dimensions entered with exactness<br />
though one experiences a warped perception,<br />
<br />
like light refractions <br />
that bend one’s sight <br />
to create a slanted impression<br />
<br />
that causes<br />
fluctuations in height <br />
and degree,<br />
<br />
as posture proposes an inclination<br />
drawn towards magnetic north,<br />
creating optical illusions<br />
<br />
that impress and amaze.<br />
This scientific disturbance<br />
is an excursionist’s dream.<br />
<br />

<h2><a id="C15">Waking Dreams</a></h2>
<h3><i>Donielle Carr</i></h3>
<p>
And in the dark, there was a light that cast an apparition.<br />
Intertwining umbrage create an inkblot of the night,<br />
As it clung to the sky, I crossed its path.<br />
It being the barrier that existed within my own state of mind,<br />
And if that is the case...<br />
Then maybe I could, despite trepidation,<br />
Break this barrier.<br />
Explore the other side and come out alive.<br />
Saying alive is too say awake,<br />
As in lifting your lids from a slumber so deep,<br />
That the fog dissipates,<br />
Allowing you to take breath<br />
And realize that you create your world.<br />
Expand your consciousness, and in it, your reality.  <br />
<br />

<h2><a id="C16">What the Air Makes Clear</a></h2>
<h3><i> Grace Watson</i></h3>

<p>
Wind mixes the dirts<br />
and awakens the trees.<br />
The world unfolds in spurts;<br />
a breeze attempting to steal the leaves.<br />
<br />
Air strives to leave the atmosphere.<br />
A silent exodus<br />
makes clear<br />
the emptiness in us.<br />
<br />
Music of crickets<br />
leaves us in admiration.<br />
The apathy of our essence it exhibits,<br />
when our only link to creation is flirtation.<br />
<br />
Disconnected from the source,<br />
it’s no surprise we lost our course.<br />
<br />

<h2><a id="C17">Zombie</a></h2>
<h3><i>Donielle Carr</i></h3>

<p>
She thrust her fist through the Earth.<br />
Departed no more, she is an entity<br />
at once lost to the grave,<br />
now animated through creation.<br />
Mortality reaped by vitality.<br />
<br />
She crawls across the dew-dripped grass.<br />
A being of demise<br />
recently deceased,<br />
yet pulsating palpably.<br />
Life after afterlife.<br />
<br />
She shambles upon a wrought-iron archway.<br />
The end begins<br />
a new existence,<br />
fatality a fleeting moment.<br />
Quietus deafened by quintessence.<br />
<br />
She moans vigorously.<br />
A monster in the night.<br />
Lost between the living and the dead.<br />
<br />
