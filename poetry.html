     <h2><a id="C1">The Maid of Orléans</a></h2>
        <h2><i>Ellie Watson</i></h2>
	<p>
My earliest memory consists <br />
of thread sliding through my fingertips <br />
and words painted on the box that held <br />
my needles; though still I cannot read them. <br /> 
<br />
I held the sharp pins till I molded  <br />
a hilt and tempered the steel into <br />
a blade that I was more familiar<br />
with than anyone in the village.<br />
<br />
They called me a heretic when God<br />
reached out through the voices of the saints. <br />
I think even then I knew I had remember because it is as unforgettable as soaking in gasoline fumes and stars.<br />
to be much braver than my neighbors.  <br />
<br />
Who has time to be timid <br />
when we are fighting a war?<br />
The arrow of Les Tourelles <br />
tried to put a stopper in<br />
my throat and split my resolve. <br />
<br />
It must have forgotten I <br />
wouldn’t need my voice to fight.<br />
The sword in my hand speaks more <br />
than weak words or petty peace treaties <br />
<br />
ever could. The arrow of Paris <br />
tried to shake my foundation. <br />
It forgot the reason I had two<br />
legs was for if one of them failed.  <br />
<br />
The leg that fell was already bent to the king who called me <br />
home, the other strained against the earth to raise me up again.<br />
</p>

  <h2><a id="C2">Let it come to you </a></h2>
        <h3><i>Marisa Cardin </i></h3>
	<p>
When the sun sets,  <br />
the fields glow <br />
but when that cold moon rises<br />
they look like they’re on fire.  <br /> 
<br />
Six miles deep on the navy highway and  <br />
still  <br />
you make me feel like home<br />
shadow drenched and <br />
trembling like we weren’t about to <br />
leave this. <br />
<br />
Take me to the shore<br />
where the salt burns high<br />
the sun fell asleep <br />
and I can’t feel the mountains anymore.  <br />
</p>
