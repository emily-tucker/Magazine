     <h2><a id="C4">LATE NIGHT SNACK</a></h2>
        <h3><i>AJ Dambly</i></h3>
        
      <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            It was cold; it had been for the last two months. White tufts of snow danced in the wind as I walked back from Love’s. This blizzard wasn’t the worst I’d seen since I’d begun life in Gunnison, but it was enough to disrupt visibility. Not that I cared much. It was 2am on a Tuesday during finals week. Not a soul was out on the icy streets of Gunnison. I walked down Highway 50, the wind at my back. A friend had told me of a faster way to get back to campus by cutting through the side streets to the north. Not wanting to stay in this weather more than I needed to, I elected to take the route. I wasn’t sure exactly of the path, but it is pretty hard to get lost in Gunny, even if I was just a freshman. I turned down the street by Taco Bell and headed north. The storm began to pick up. The wind went from whispering in my ear, to howling. Tugging my hood further over my face, I trudged on. A faint wail came from behind me. Looking back, I saw a slim grey shadow standing under a pine. I blinked once, and it was gone.
             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“It’s just the wind; man I’m tired.” I reassured myself aloud. My thoughts turned to my finals the next day. I had four. Math, Biology, Psych, and--. The wail sounded from in front of me this time. I looked up from the white street to see the same grey form standing maybe 30 yards in front of me across the intersection. A white curtain was pulled over the slender shape within seconds. I reacted by turning left down the street as I quickened my pace. I looked for the street signs or any indication of my position. Nothing familiar was within my vision. The snow and ice had wrapped the street signs in a cold embrace. A monstrous roar sounded in the veil. From the storm, the figure appeared once more. The storm swirled around its shape. It stood not twenty feet from me, at a height too tall and a figure too slender for any human. Glowing yellow eyes burned into me from between its long pointed ears. Below the eyes, spear-like teeth formed an evil smile. The creature stepped forward. One pale, bony hand, equipped with razor sharp nails, reached towards me. I turned and ran. I didn’t know where I was. I couldn’t find any landmarks. Nothing to tell me where I should run. So I just ran. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I was trapped in a white maze. Hunted by a demon that seemed to control it. Wherever I turned, I felt as if I was running into more danger. Stopping by a tree, I tried to catch my breath. My breathing was ragged. My legs ached. My heart beat at a killing pace attempting to deliver enough oxygen to my body. How long had I been running? How far was I from campus? Leaning up against the tree, I looked into the blizzard. From the pale darkness, the eyes returned. I couldn’t run. Aside from exhaustion, fear had me in a vice grip. I watched as the beast’s form inched closer. The howling storm revealing each grotesque portion of its body one piece at a time. Long pointed ears. The monster’s hand grasped my throat, lifting me to its eye level. Its touch was even colder than the storm around us. Each breath was foul. The smell of rotting flesh flowed through its fangs into my nose. I closed my eyes. My past began to appear before me. What would my friends and family think when the police found my body? Would the police find my body?
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I was ripped back into reality by the creature’s scream. It released my throat, which sent me falling to the ground. My legs buckled as I crashed into the snowy floor. Coughing, I fought to get my breath back. I looked up to see the monster bent over clutching at its chest. Black blood flowed through its thin fingers, corrupting the perfect white snow. From the shadows, another form appeared between the demon and me. This one was human. It stood dressed in all black, its face covered by a hood and mask. As one gloved hand lifted me onto my feet, my eyes caught the form of a sword in the other. Black blood dripped from the blade.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Flee. Now.” A young man’s voice commanded me. He pointed the tip of his blade into the storm.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I nodded, still coughing. The swordsman turned to face the monster. Icy winds tugged at his cloak. The creature roared in challenge. Its eyes now filled with anger towards my savior. My adrenaline surged, forcing my feet to carry me where the man had pointed. After the first few steps I could no longer hear the sound of their battle. Yet, I didn’t dare look back. I ran through the howling storm as straight and as fast as I could. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The storm began to subside as I reached campus. Violent winds had settled into a calm breeze. The clouds separated, revealing the twinkling stars overhead. I walked across campus into Dolores Hall. When I opened the door, I found my roommate still studying at his desk.
“How was your walk?” He looked up from his work. “Are you alright? Your jacket is ripped.” His facial expression turned to concern.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I felt around my neck, there were three tears from the creature’s claws. I said nothing as I removed my outer layers and entered my bed. Before I resigned myself to sleep, I had one clear thought.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I am never going out for a late night snack again.
<br />
<br />

            <h2><a id="C5">THE CROSSING</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Jonathan Gossman</i></h3>
        
      <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The living room gave a chilling blue glow.  Gordon’s relatives crammed together as they filled up the room.  No one dared disturb the hospital bed sprung in the corner, or his decaying body caressed between little white waves and tunnels in the bed sheets.  The faint light carrying the dawn lingered Passing, a gray chalky haze; untouchable, yet pervading and patient.
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But that gray chalky haze only captivated Gordon.  He left his body empty, and that was a good feeling.  He was, again, rid of the cancer that had held him back for the past two years.  He had beaten it once, and that was a miracle — perhaps more of a blessing, but now he felt empty, and that emptiness was healthier than anything he’d known for the past two years.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Gordon.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He knew that voice.  It belonged to a power, a power he identified as his master since he first felt Him in the physical world; a power he had dedicated his life to.  He lingered in the corner, His white eminence defined by long, dark, wavy hair, and a beard that topped his own.  Gordon wouldn’t mistake his master for half a man, half a god; no, He was fully man and fully God.  Without his mediator, Gordon would be lost in the chalky haze.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
His Master’s thundering, yet gentle voice permeated the gray haze, striking a respective fear into Gordon and the darkness.  It guided Gordon off the bed and across the room through his family members.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Have you come to take me home?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Yes, my son, but all of that depends on you.  Are you ready to leave this world and everyone in it?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Of course! I’ve been sick for two years.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Master put a brightly robed arm around Gordon.  Gordon felt it levitate the struggle, the stress, and the pain he’d felt for the past two years.  “That’s not what I asked, Gordon. Are you ready to leave everyone?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The question was more direct than inquisitive.  Gordon searched through his brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces and in-laws for his wife, but then he remembered she’d retired to their old bedroom.  She needed rest.  ‘In sickness and health”; that was what she promised, and she had done everything she could to hold her end of the love for him.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“A lot of the times I wonder if she would’ve been happier without me.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“And if so?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I just hope she wouldn’t.  I mean, I was married to her for thirteen years.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“And if so?  What is that to you?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I don’t suppose it should be anything, really. I just thought we wouldn’t cross too far apart from each other.  I hope to see her again soon.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Is worrying going to add anything to your life?  He picked a good one for you, my Father did.  A little too good for you, wouldn’t you say?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Oh, definitely.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“She loves Him very much, you know, nearly more than anything He’s tested her with.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Oh, I know. That’s one of the reasons I love her.”
“And you know neither of you will ever be the same after both of you cross.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Yes.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Let me know something, Gordon.  You said you were married to her.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“God would have blessed me with fourteen years if he let me make it to June.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Are you sure it wasn’t the other way around? Were you married to her like she was married to you?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“What are you saying?  I loved her!  We had three beautiful boys!”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“And is not part of love caring for your body?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Y—Yes, LORD.  Yes, it is.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“The question still stands.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I . . . I don’t think I ever thought of it that way.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“She may not look it now, but soon, she’ll be relieved to not have to wear a dress to Sunday service anymore.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I think I would be too . . . But I liked wearing the suit and tie. I was proud to wear it.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I KNOW.  My Father accounts for everything you’ve done in His name.  But Gordon, do you remember how hard it is for a rich man to enter Paradise?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, I remember.  I preached on that passage more times than I can count."
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“You haven’t stopped looking at your family.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon paused.  If only there was a little more time.
“What did I say?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“That anyone who puts his hand on the plow and looks back is not fit . . . for the Kingdom, LORD.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
His Master lingered in silence, its faint cloud of a robe gently stirring like an impending storm.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I . . . I just thought I would live to be older.  I thought I would watch my boys grow into men.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Don’t worry.  Everything is under control.  He has other plans for them.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 “LORD, I know I ask for quite a lot, a lot more than I believe I should, but please tell me what is next for them.  What will happen to my family once I am gone?”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“The next step of my Father’s plan will happen once you are gone.  It cannot happen until you are gone.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon turned to Him.  Had he been in his body, the fear and respect his Master gave off may have killed him, but for the time being, he could handle it.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“You must trust that He will pull through.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I trust.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“And can you handle that?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“What’s good for You, LORD, is good for me.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Is it?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon stood in silence.  He hesitated to accept it, but he realized his body was no use to him anymore.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“There is someone in your community He is raising up for her; someone who will make her just as happy.  She will bring the LORD back to him, and he will love her until I come for him as well.  He will be a walking encyclopedia of intellectuality for your wife and a war of enlightenment on your boys.  He will provide more than their every need, but most importantly, he will teach them how to think rather than what to think.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Those were good traits — a little too good.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“So basically he’ll be better in every way that I wasn’t.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“If so, what is that to you?  Didn’t you want this?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“We talked about this just in case it ever happened.  I told her to remarry if I were to die before the boys grew up.  I just wanted her to be happy, but I never thought it would actually happen.  LORD, I would be very grateful to be liberated from that cancerous body, but is there any chance You can just heal me and allow me finish Your work?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“You’re afraid.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“LORD, the congregation will tear her apart if she remarries!”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“With more judgment than mercy, but his must happen to humble the proud and honor the humble.  That is why my Father is providing a helper for her when that time comes, so that she won’t be alone.  Her testing isn’t done yet, so my Father is about to provide her with everything she needs.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
That’s good.  Very good.  Yet still, why couldn’t it be him?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“LORD, what about my boys? They’re not up here (which I’m glad for by the way), but it doesn’t look like I’ll get to see them before I leave.  May I see them one last time?”
“You’ll see them.  Don’t focus on giving them closure; that is not what my Father wants.  As for plans, that will be revealed in time.  He is aware of the plans He has for them, but He is also aware of the condition of their hearts.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“LORD, if it is not for their closure, then please let it be mine.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon’s Master looked at him with a fatherly stare.  He looked prepared for that question.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Very well.”  Gordon’s master gently squeezed his shoulders around Gordon, and a light permeated his vision.  The light warred with his desires for closure, and it was a little painful.  A rush of gray, chalky haze passed around them, and a carpeted room with a basement window leaking in the dawn wrinkled before them.  Gordon fell with his knees to the floor and realized he was in the guest room in the basement they’d turned into a bedroom.  Underneath the covers of the bed in the corner lay his first son.  But also in the corner hovered a rushing void of blackness, sprawled on the wall like a camel spider.  Its darkness intimidated Gordon and caught him off guard.  He stood petrified.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The blackness gave a jaw-wrenching screech as soon as it saw Gordon’s Master.  It swirled up through the ceiling and out the window without waking up his son.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“What was that?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“The answer to a prayer.  Andrew is about to have trouble with him, but it would be best to keep Hell at bay for the time being.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon hesitated.  Perhaps Andrew’s paranormal stories hadn’t been so made up for attention after all.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Time is running out, Gordon; that is, if you want to see your wife one last time.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Gordon neared the bed and reached out toward touch his son.  If he didn’t need his body to form tears, this would begin their descent.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Andrew, I don’t think we’ll have time to talk again.  I’m too sick to keep going, and the LORD is taking me home today.  One day, I hope you’ll join me.  Just let Him do his work.  I know you’ve never been accepted by anybody at school until now; just hold on to those blessings as long as you can.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Gordon.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I don’t have much time.  Just give your all to the LORD and He will give His all to you.  I love you, and I’ll pray for you. I hope to be there when you cross.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The grayness wrinkled around Gordon and took him down the hallway into the main room of the basement.  His second son lay prostrate in a sleeping bag.  He’d been banished from his own room to make room for his aunt and uncle.  This time, there was no blackness or decadent demon clamped to the wall.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“What about Jonathan?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“He made you a card the night before last.  He’ll take your passing worse than the other two, but my Father has grand plans for him, and He will reveal His plans for him to keep him out of trouble and away from the Evil One.  But he will only be successful if he continues to follow Him.  My Father’s bestowed him with many talents.  I want him to be a writer like your wife.  But like Solomon and David, it will be hard for him to divert from the women my Father puts in his life and follow Him instead.  After you pass, he’ll search for hope and companionship in his crushes.  But don’t worry.  He’ll only have crushes on pure women, and hope to maintain their innocence by keeping his own.  But they won’t accept him because of his looks.  I’m saving his good years for after college.  Each year will be harder than the next.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Oh boy.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon neared his second son.  He spilled out everything he thought of saying to him on that hospital bed.  The Spirit lingered in patience.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“It looks like you’ll have some hard testing ahead of you, Jonathan.  All I can say is acknowledge God for who He is; it’ll get you through a lot.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He couldn’t think of any more to say.  Jonathan didn’t have problems with school like Andrew did; not because he was smarter, but because he had vastly different prerogatives than Andrew.  They were both really nice and respectful, but that’s what caused other people to walk all over them sometimes.  They were much like him when he was younger.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Gordon.  Your body only has a little time left.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The gray haze wrinkled into another image, and Gordon was placed upstairs in the third son’s bedroom.  Stephen was only seven.  This was the age he needed his dad most.
“I love him.  I love him the most.  I don’t know why, but I do.  I feel like I played favorites with him over the other two.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
His master stood in silence, ominous yet demanding the parts of him that waged against peace.  Gordon knelt before the bed of his youngest son. Stephen might never hear these last words.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Stephen, I need you to know that I love you.  I’m glad the LORD has blessed me with you, but I have to go now, and I don’t think I’ll be coming back this time.  You’ll have to wait for me.  Please know I’m not leaving you.  The LORD says this has to happen for the better.”
“Gordon.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“J – just a moment please.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Gordon!”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The second call was more of a command.  Gordon humbly turned toward his Master, away from his youngest.
“All this time you have only been visiting those most important to you.  You want my Father to protect them, but you also want them to have a hard time without you.  Well, they will.  That’s inevitable.  They will have their grief.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
His Master let that statement hang in the haze, but it seemed like that statement directed Gordon to question his intentions as well as himself.  Gordon fell on his knees and bowed his head to the floor.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“My Sovereign LORD, I’m so very sorry.  Who do You want me to see?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The gray haze swirled around Gordon again.  A chaotic image of scattered Passing wrinkled into a familiar dirt road on the outside of a ranch.  For some reason, the haze was lighter, and the physical world seemed to be seeping its boundaries into the purgatorial existence.  Behind the translucent, gray curtain of Sheol was Mr. and Mrs. Stanley’s house, some very supportive members of his congregation.  The God-man walked Gordon toward the house.
“These may be your most humble sheep.  Their love is strong not only for one another, but for my Father as well.  Their prayers for you and your family have been robust and resilient.  They took care of your boys while you were in the hospital for a while, and in this time of trouble, as a reward, my Father has planned to give them the assurance that He is still watching over them.”
As they came to the porch, Mr. Stanley came out the front door to start the regular chores on the ranch.  He passed right through Gordon and the Spirit as he put his hat on.  The Spirit led Gordon into the house just before the door could swing shut.  He led Gordon through the house and into Mr. and Mrs. Stanley’s bedroom.  Mrs. Stanley lay undisturbed, getting some shuteye before her alarm sounded.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“You are more physical now,” said the Spirit.  “She will hear what you have to say, but she won’t see you. Make sure you let her know you were there. ”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon stood motionless.  These may be the final words he would be able to preach on earth.  This would be his last time to give the world the advice he had preached about for years in the church. How could he sum it up in one sentence?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Gordon, my Father is at work.  You must trust that He will do his job.  He loves your congregation, and He appointed you to steer them in the right path.  But you must surrender that you can’t do everything by yourself.  Remember: I AM bigger.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I AM bigger.  Those words reminded him of everything he needed to know if he were to make it to Paradise.  For generations, his church was caught in the physical realm of things.  Sure, they knew about God and had read the Bible, but they always only looked to him for answers.  Their thought must be that, if they could please him, they must be pleasing God.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon leaned over the bed where Mr. Stanley had awoken from and pressed his hand onto the sheets.  The sheets folded into the shape of his hand, but Mrs. Stanley didn’t budge, so he sat, putting his whole weight onto the bed.  He could feel her open her eyes.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Don’t grieve for me.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon rose from the bed as Mrs. Stanley threw her neck behind her.  She stared around the room, unaware of the Spirit or of her pastor.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Harry?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“She knows,” his Master said.  “It’s time.”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The chalky grayness of Sheol melded Gordon and the Spirit into the scattering chaotic wind of darkness.  Only the Spirit was the light source.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon had forgotten just who his Master was before now.  Maybe years of strenuous sermon-making had caused him to forget.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Gordon,” the Spirit thundered, “I called you into this world forty-three years ago on August the 26th, 1962.  I called you into the ministry to shed the little bit of light my Father gave you onto your world.  For every command I have given you, I have provided you the tools to execute.  I gave you a supportive and loving wife, and three precious boys.  In turn, you have taken up your cross and followed me, and now, Gordon Wayne Gossman, I AM calling you home.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Did the LORD allow you to let me be stubborn so I would pass!?!” Gordon tried to ask over the sound of the chaos.
“Let Me tell you something, Gordon.  If you still have ears, let yourself hear,” the Spirit thundered with no struggle and rose over Gordon.  “It is not how many deeds you have done or how much faith you allow yourself to have that gets you into Paradise.  Instead, your faith in my Father will show by your deeds.  What matters is whether or not you will accept my Father when you die.  Have you let Me pervade through you that you may cast aside this evil body, and entrust everything of yourself to Him?  Or, are you comfortable with the world so much that you end up deciding to stay in your body, and run toward Destruction?  Where will you cross when you die?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“You mean I’m not dead yet?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“For the most part!”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Spirit and the grayness enveloped into a bright tube of light that caught Gordon and sent him through a purple and blue time and space like a roller coaster.  A flash spread through his mind, and he began to hear again.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“He’s moving.  Someone go get Lisa!”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The family members all huddled around the hospital bed.  Gordon was delirious.  He looked around, and he saw everyone the LORD had blessed him.  These were the people who stood by him as a pastor, who watched him grow up, who grew up with him, and the ones who entrusted him with their daughter.  But where was she?  He began shaking, and he shouted for his wife in his head, but his sick body wouldn’t let him squeeze out the call.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I’m here.”  His relatives let his wife pass.  Tears streamed down her face.  She’d forgotten to put on her glasses.  He reached out for her, and she grabbed hold of his hand and knelt at his side.  She held it more tightly than she’d ever held it before.  If there was ever a time he wanted to let his wife know that he loved her and had always loved her, it was now, but he was too sick to mutter even one breath of it.  Still, her touch calmed him down, and with one small, eternal last look into his wife’s turquoise eyes, eyes she had given all three of their boys, he surrendered himself, and gladly gave up his body in defeat.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The soft, calming tension of his hand let her know that he was married to her just as much as she had been married to him.

            <h2><a id="C6">THE LOVE OF A MOTHER</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Alexandria Bentler</i></h3>
        
      <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            	I roll over and put my hand on my wife’s stomach.  She smiles at me and I can see she is finally happy.  We have been trying so hard to have a baby, and each failed attempt pushed her deeper and deeper into depression, slowly crushing her.  If someone had told us six months ago that we were going to have a baby, I would have looked at them as if they were incompetent, but now here I lay with my pregnant wife.  She playfully pushes my hands away and giggles.
                <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“I told you it feels weird for you to have your hands on my stomach all the time.”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“But I never get to feel her move!” I complain as I let my hands drop on the bed.  She smiles and looks at our clock sitting on the nightstand next to our bed.  I remember marking today on the calendar as ultrasound day.  She is glowing; I love seeing her happy.  She is going to bring a miracle into this world, our miracle.  We both sit up and start our day.  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Don’t forget to make yourself a lunch, Hun,” she orders from the bathroom.  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Will do,” I shout back as I pull on my pants, nearly falling over in the process.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“I want to go by myself, you know, so you don’t have to see me vulnerable like that.”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Why? I want to be there for you; I want to be your support.”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“I know, and I love you for that, but I just don’t want you to be put in that weird position.  I love you so much and I want you to be involved. How about you go to the doctor appointment next week?” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Ok, fine,” I mumble.  I know I am defeated so I better just stop before I piss her off again.  I throw myself back on the bed and listen to her walk toward the door.  I hear it open with the usual, “I love you,” shouted at me; then it closes and I am alone. I just want to be there for her; I feel like the worst husband on the face of the planet.  I haven’t even rubbed her stomach or talked to our baby.  How am I going to be a good father if I can’t even be a good husband to my wife? 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	“Honey, wake up!” she yells as she shakes me.  
Dazzled I quickly sit up, I must have dozed off.  “Sorry, Gretchen,” I sputter. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Gretchen waves pieces of paper in my face.  I reach for them as she giggles.  Her eyes are filled with excitement.  I look at the papers and I feel hot tears run down my cheeks. I let out a stifled sigh.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Those are our babies, Phillip,” she says as she embraces me in the warmest hug I have ever had.  I stare in awe at the two faces in the photos: twins. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	“Do-do you know if they’re girls or boys yet?”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“One of each.”  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	I stare into her eyes.  I cannot think of a single word to say to this amazing woman.  She is going to bring two miracles into this world now, and there is no way I am able to put my gratitude into words.  I stare into her big green eyes for so long that I lose track of time.  I hope our children have her eyes, so innocent, so honest.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
	“Baby, will you do me a huge favor?” she purrs, breaking our peaceful silence. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I look at her and smile, assuring her that I am willing to do anything for her.  More than she may even understand.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Will you run to the store and pick up some tomatoes for me?  I don’t know why but I am craving tomatoes.”   She looks at me, awaiting my answer with the utmost anticipation.  She must really want them.  I have heard of weird things pregnant woman crave so I had better be quick before her hormones get the best of her.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Anything for you, my love,” I say, rubbing her hands.  
She smiles at me and I take it all in as much as I can.  Even being away from her for minutes feels like an eternity of emptiness.  I love her so much.  I dash out and start the car.  As giddy as a teenaged boy about to have his first kiss, I drive the twenty-minute trip into town and waste no time at all.  I pull back into the driveway in record time with a bag of tomatoes in my hand.  I want to give her the right amount to satisfy her craving.  Rushing through the door, I sing, “Honey, I’m home.”  Giggling to myself at my ridiculous reference, I listen for her response.  She always responds with something so witty, she really is amazing. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	No response.  Maybe she went to the neighbor’s house.  She goes over there when she has pain.  I reach for the phone and nervously dial the number.  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Hello?”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Hi, Journey, is Gretchen there by any chance?”  There is a pause on her line and my heart rate rises with each millisecond. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“No one told you?” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
My heart drops. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Gretchen is in the hospital, she went into labor.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	My breath catches in my throat and it hurts to breath. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Phillip, Phillip?” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I slam the phone on the receiver and run out the door.  Thick tears run down my face.  It’s too early for her to deliver our babies, too early.  My worry shoots from Gretchen, to our babies, and back to Gretchen.  It only takes thirty minutes to drive to the hospital, but it feels like I have been driving for days.  I whip into the entrance like a speed racer, with no concern for anyone except my wife.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Sir, how may I help you?” asks a concerned nurse.  
All I can manage to say is, “Gretchen Williams.” 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
She leads me down white halls that seem to be miles long.  Further and further away from my family.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	“She is tired, Sir; please be quick so she can rest.” She motions me into one of the rooms.  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I slowly walk in, searching for my babies.  I see nothing except a tired-looking wife.  Her stomach is much smaller.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Did you deliver?” I whisper.  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She lifts up her gown revealing a long stitched cut on her stomach. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	“Where are they?” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
She looks away from me, covers her face and moans.  Shivers run up and down my spine as if the grim reaper that stole my babies from me is running his fingers up and down my back.  Gretchen starts screaming at the top of her lungs, a mother who has had her children stolen from her.  I run over and rub her arms.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“You would have been a good daddy,” she moans.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
A knot forms in my throat and I feel hot all over my body.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“You would have been a good mommy, my love,” I assure her.  She would have been; I can see it.  I walk out of the room as the nurse walks in and sedates her.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	“She is free to go when she wakes up, Sir.” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
I nod, not saying a word.  My family gone, how am I going to take Gretchen’s depression when I myself am in the same dark place?  I wait in the room for what seems like hours until they finally bring out my wife in a wheelchair.  Looking at her in such a state makes me shutter.  Not a word is said during the drive home.  I tuck her into bed and kiss her on the forehead.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“I want a funeral for both of them.”  She cries.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
	“Yes, of course,” I reply zombielike.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	There is a knock at the door and I go investigate.  Its Journey.  I open the door and invite her in.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“May I talk to her?”  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I point to her room and watch Journey walk into the room and close the door. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                           
Decades seem to pass.  Journey runs out of the room with tears on her rosy cheeks.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“I-I don’t know what ha-happened,” she sputters. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
I run into the room and stare at my unconscious wife.  I carry her to the car, passing a hysterical Journey on the way.  Going to the hospital seems like seconds now.  The adrenaline is speeding up my world.  The doctors take her, leaving me in the main room.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“You sons of bitches are going to get her killed with whatever you fucked up!” I bellow.  I just lost my babies and I can’t take losing Gretchen too.  
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Sir, please don’t make a scene; we are doing our best,” defends my wife’s doctor.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“If she dies, it’s on you!”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Sir, she is stable; she is fine.”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“She didn’t look stable to me!”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Sir, please calm down.”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Calm down?  How can I calm down, knowing you don’t give a shit about these women? How many C-sections have you fucked up?” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“C-sections sir?  I am not quite sure how that applies to-”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“My babies are gone; don’t let me lose my wife too. Please.” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He looks at me baffled.  I wait for him to break the silence; I can barely stand the look on his face. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	“Mrs. William’s tubal ligation took place six years ago.”  He continues to stare at me perplexed. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
I freeze and drop to my knees.  “But the C-section…”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“That was an accident with a knife, Sir.  She fell down the stairs at your house and cut herself.  It’s not serious I assure you.” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I stare at him for a long time.  “We don’t have any stairs.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Oh dear, Sir, have you ever heard of a disorder called Munchausen’s?”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	I look up at him with doubt.  I walk over to my wife’s room and look at her lying in the bed.  She looks up at me and hides her face. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	“A problem with the C-section?”
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	“Yes, the doctor said there was a piece of the placenta still in me.  It’s out now though they think.  I may have to stay for a while.” 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	Speechless I stare at my wife.  That is not the woman I married; I do not recognize her. I walk out of the room down the hall and out the door.  I walk past my car.  I walk down the street.  I never want to stop walking; I just want to walk away from this life and what could have been.
    <br />

        	<p>
           
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She crawled between the two overgrown hedges, holding the fraying straps of her backpack firmly against her shoulders while the rough twigs pulled back, catching stray threads with their unkempt fingers. With a final tug, she pulled herself free from the undergrowth tunnel, and stretched into the shade of the underpass. The hardy plants had grown around it, broken through crumbling concrete, took water from the dust, and turned the light beneath the underpass a delicate, 
warm green.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
The cool air welled up from the ground itself—from asphalt that never saw the sun. She gingerly pulled her pack off and dropped it into her hands, rolling her shoulders back and forth, slowly, painfully, trying to unknot the twanging muscles. This place felt like home, if anything could anymore. She ran her calloused fingers against the pylons, feeling the stony surface and the occasional ridge of rebar, winding her way between the pillars. She’d ripped the doors off of old cars and propped them on dead branches and animal bones between the concrete towers. Her mother told her once that the smell of death and gasoline would keep anything away. She collapsed down into her makeshift nest of thin, torn blankets and let the cool seep up from the ground into her flushed limbs. The canned food she had raided from the houses that day could wait until she was rested. She curled her arm protectively around her backpack in the shade of the underpass.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
***
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
She dreamt of her mother. She often did. It was part of the reason she left the old house. She thought it must have memories in the walls, going back generations through her family. She thought that if she left, the dreams would stop. They didn’t. But even so, the house was cavernous when she was the only one in it. The wind shook the walls and the rafters, and they creaked, which spooked her. In her dream, her mother spoke in the voice of the wind and the walls, from the kitchen downstairs, ever so softly, just on the edge of hearing. In her dream, she would creep down the long wooden stairs as they groaned beneath her weight, until she could finally hear her mother whisper Amelia. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
It was the only time she ever heard her name anymore. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
***
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Amelia woke with a start just before sunset. She stretched her arms up over her head, accidentally knocking her backpack onto the ground. The canned foods rolled into the dust. Struggling to wake herself up enough to gather the cans, she set them next to her. She dug into the pockets of her pack until she came up with a small hammer and an old nail, and pried the lids off.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
The sharp, metallic scent of aluminum sprang from the punctured metal. Amelia’s mother always wrinkled her nose at it. She said that each year it seemed that the smell got worse, and she missed eating food that didn’t taste of can. Amelia couldn’t even imagine—for her, it was a spice.	
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
It was a can of peaches. She stuck her hands in and sucked the little orange slices off her fingers. Thick syrup dribbled down her wrists, and she licked it off. It was so sweet, sweeter than anything she had ever eaten before. Once, her mother had promised her that she would have a cake for her birthday. It would be hard work, finding flour without worms, and butter that wasn’t yet rancid. But it would be worth it, her mother had said, clapping her on the back, so my daughter can have cake on her birthday. Her mother never did make her a cake that year. But the peaches were still delicious. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Amelia hoisted herself up and slung her pack over her shoulder. It stayed temperate in her little vegetative cave, but she could tell the air outside had finally started to cool. She could go out again. She didn’t really need more food, but a whole night wasted on her own plagued her. Amelia and her mother used to have fire nights. They’d build a fire in the fireplace at the old house and roast marshmallows, if they could find them, and talk. They wouldn’t go out scavenging that night; they’d just rest and eat around a fire they didn’t need. Her mother said she used to do something similar with Amelia’s grandmother, but in the woods. It sounded nice.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
***
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Amelia walked down all the cracked streets her mother took her to as a child. She let herself into all the abandoned houses and rifled through the cupboards, picking up cans here and there, sometimes bags of dried foods. She even found a plastic bottle – it was empty, but she collected it anyway. As her mother always said, you can never have too much plastic. Anything to catch the rainwater, right, darlin’? 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
It hardly ever rained. The sky was as clear as a window in a shopping mall. Her mother said that, a long time ago, and Amelia picked it up and repeated it. It was something you said. And why you always needed more plastic. Amelia kicked at the cracking, dry earth with the toe of her boot. She walked along the curb of the street, kicking up dust like a kid, like her mother always told her not to do. It gets everywhere, and then we have to figure a way to wash your clothes for no good reason. And wouldn’t you rather be drinking that water? Amelia sometimes ignored her mother and did it anyway, like a kid would. But now she wasn’t like a kid anymore, so she stopped. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
She walked up to the big ditch at the end of the road, the one that her mother had said was a construction site. When she looked down the steep hill of piled up dirt, she knew she wouldn’t see anything. She had been torn apart by animals by now. Even the bones were scattered. Even the bones. But Amelia still looked down and listened closely for the quiet ghost of a voice in a dream. Sometimes on her birthday, Amelia wished she had been able to try cake, but more often, she wished that cake had never existed, that the idea of its sweetness could never have taken root, so that she could eat canned peaches 
on fire nights.

        <h2><a id="C2">The Priest</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Tyler Brant</i></h3> 
        
        	<p>
           <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

            “Tell me, Major, are you frightened of what we may find today?” I said. I set aside the file I had been using on my nails and turned to the pudgy man beside me. He shifted in his seat a little and chuckled.
           <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “I fought the Boers in the South of Africa. I’ve shot rebels in East India, and I led Her Majesty’s men through the trenches in France only six years ago. I’ve seen plenty of bodies, and today I may see one more. Mummified or not, that’s all it will be,” he said.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “That’s quite a confident attitude.”
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “You’ve seen a lot of life by my age. I should doubt that there’s anything left in this world to surprise me.”
   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    I couldn’t keep a brief smile from crossing my face. The Major pulled a glass flask from inside his guayabera and took a deep swig. He proffered the thing in my direction, but I waved it away. I squinted into the hills beyond our campsite
and saw our crew hard at work. Boys and young men carried Egyptian sand like ants from an anthill. A stone structure was slowly taking form from beneath the waste. Watching them made me happy to be in the shade. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    An hour later, I had returned to filing my nails. They were nearly perfect. My counterpart had dozed off and was snoring gently. We both jumped when a bronze-skinned kid ran up and shouted at us in Arabic. The Major screwed his eyebrows up in puzzlement, but the words were perfectly clear to me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “They’ve found the entrance and are preparing to open it,” I said.
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    We followed the boy over the hot, cracked ground to the excavation site. Sure enough, several sweating men had metal bars and were working to pry away a sandstone panel on the uncovered structure. There was a loud crack, and pieces of the slab fell away, revealing a dark passageway. Several of the workers brought torches and lanterns from the camp, and they banished the blackness of the hall as they entered. Intricate hieroglyphs and pictographs ran on down the walls, seemingly as vivid as the day they were painted. I only looked them over briefly.
   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “These say that we’re in the tomb of a priest of Osiris,” I said.
   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “Incredible! You can read this mess that easily?”
   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “Certainly, Major. That is what you hired me for.”
   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    We followed the passage to its end, where another stone slab blocked our progression. Our young workers took their pry bars to it, and it soon lay at our feet. A large chamber loomed before us.
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    We stepped into the room and brought light to it for the first time in three thousand years. An enormous sarcophagus lay at the center of the room. The workers began trying to lift away its heavy stone lid, with the Major standing over them. The walls were even more ornately decorated than the ones in the hall had been. Along the back wall a graphic portrait of the priest looked out at the room, his arms crossed over his chest. I stepped up to it. An echoing boom signaled the removal of the sarcophagus lid behind me. I turned to face the Major.
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    “Well, if that isn’t the damndest thing!” said the Major. He took a sip from his flask. He looked up at me. The flask shattered as it hit the floor. With a yell, the Major and the workers fled the room.
   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

    I sauntered up to the sarcophagus. Only dust lay in it. I leaned against it and looked again at the painting. Of course, I recognized my own face staring back at me. I glanced down to the hands and smiled. The fingernails were perfect. Osiris had been good to me. 
   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

           Faded fall colors cascaded from my bag the day I decided to turn it up. “Okay, so I bought a maxi-skirt at the Tobacconist and then a bunch of glitter and face paint at Walmart. Do we need anything else?” 
           <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

Becca looked at me with a huge grin on her face. “Yeah, here!” she handed me a can of Pabst, “drink up!” 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

We spent the next two hours emptying beer cans into our mouths, paint tubes on our faces, and glitter packets into our hair in preparation for Crested Butte’s Vinotok celebration.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

I have attended Western since I was an innocent little freshman, but never have I truly partaken in the Vinotok celebrations, unlike so many of my fellow classmates. My freshman year I didn’t even know what Vinotok was, and so the weekend it was held passed by without a second thought from me. It wasn’t until the Monday after, when I finally paid attention, that I sort of understood what Vinotok was. In all of my classes I heard almost everyone talking about how much fun they had drinking or tripping up on Oh Be Joyful. What’s Oh Be Joyful? How do you even get there? What were you tripping on? Vinotok is a pagan festival? There was a fire? What just happened this weekend? 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
	
These thoughts raced through my mind and in the end I was determined to get to know Vinotok better next year, but that was just it… I had to wait a whole year to have my own experience while everyone was still raving about the one this year. I stuck through it and salivated at every mention of Vinotok I heard over the next year. I daydreamed about what my own experience would be like on Oh Be Joyful until that weekend came again. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

The next thing I knew the weekend of Vinotok was among the college kids again and I begged my boyfriend to take me. He was never particularly enthused about the whole pagan aspect of the festival and had never been to Vinotok himself, but he was down to have a little fun. I, however, was on the balls of my feet waiting to go. I always imagined Vinotok would be like my own personal experience of the witchcraft scenes in The Crucible. I just wanted to feel a sense of freedom in union with nature. I wanted to provoke the supernatural and get spirits to dance with me. I just wanted that one memory in college that I could never forget, to look back on with a smile, but that memory wasn’t ready to be made just yet. When I went to Vinotok my sophomore year it did not coincide with my imagination of it, and I realized I was entirely unprepared for the Vinotok I really wanted. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

When I arrived up in CB with my boyfriend, Alex, everyone was dressed up and we weren’t. That was the first issue and there were many more to follow. Since Alex was driving he didn’t drink and so I didn’t either, but we did take edibles when all our friends took shrooms. Those edibles put me on my ass during the festival and while seeing the Trial and Burning of the Grump was awesome, I didn’t have the surge of energy I wanted. Instead, thanks to the Cheba Chew I had earlier, I just wanted to go to sleep. In fact, the whole idea of sleep was much more attainable than my witchcraft extravaganza because I had to work early in the morning the next day. So, after the Grump was put to sleep in his bed of fire, I shortly followed suit in my bed of cotton. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

The next morning I woke up in Gunnison, not Oh Be Joyful. My pagan night with nature ended before midnight and I didn’t even dance. I was disappointed in my Vinotok attempt and left for work in a solemn silence. I racked my brain trying to understand why nothing went entertainingly right last night. I wondered how hard it was to just have a good time and why everyone around me seems to experience it with ease, and I realized that maybe I needed to recreate my entire environment before the next Vinotok. I was being honest with myself. I didn’t have fun last night with my boyfriend. I needed to let loose with friends instead of being extremely paranoid and self-conscious on weed with Alex. While Alex was a good guy, I just couldn’t be myself around him, and I definitely couldn’t be a true witch around him. I needed to be around someone on Vinotok who wanted to be a witch as bad as me, someone who would dance with me as we tried calling the spirits. I needed someone who could fully get into everything Vinotok was about, so I waited another year searching for my fellow witch.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

“I think you’re ready,” Becca said, smiling at me as I twirled around in my finished outfit. I was wearing a floor length turquoise skirt with an autumn orange jacket. An aspen tree branch, and leaves were painted across my face, and my wavy hair was littered with glitter and topped off with a band of flowers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

Becca’s outfit reflected my own in our  makeshift pagan attire. We didn’t have the means to create an authentic pagan dress, but these were close enough and really all we needed. We looked at each other and our smiles lit up the devils in our eyes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

“One more shot of liquid luck before we go?” Becca asked, already pouring a round.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

“Of course! Tonight we are witches!” I proposed as a cheer to our drink. Our glasses clinked together, slammed down on the table, and then the gin slid down our throats. Tonight I was finally prepared for Vinotok. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

We arrived in CB while the drum circles were still happening, so Becca and I immediately joined in the dancing. We flittered through the crowd following the beating music and running into friends. Every person I saw seemed to reflect in their eyes the same happiness I felt, and I was excited with Vinotok so far. Eventually, we met up with Alex and his friends and I went off with him before the Trial of the Grump. Alex and two other guys took me to where they had parked to give me the final ingredient for my night of witchcraft. This year it wasn’t a Cheba Chew, instead it was a hit of acid. I chewed the little piece of paper a bit under enthusiastically because it tasted bitter to me, but I still wanted it to make my night complete, so I swallowed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

“Do you guys have any water?” I felt like the paper was stuck in my throat.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

“Did you swallow it already? It’s only been five minutes!” One of the guys said as Alex searched for some water.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

“Babe, you’re supposed to keep it in your mouth for a while because that’s how the acid gets to your bloodstream fastest.” Alex handed me a water bottle.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

“You guys should have told me earlier! You know this is my first drug!” I was a little upset, but I felt my hit would still work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

The guys all mumbled something, maybe an apology, and we headed back to the festival. I wouldn’t let this small trip in my plans ruin my trip as a whole. We found Becca again right as everyone was gathering for the Trial. She knew where I’d gone and looked at me expectantly. The loud speakers boomed as the trial began, and all I could do was shrug. Throughout the trial everyone constantly checked to see if my trip had kicked in yet, but it hadn’t. I kept trying to fake myself into tripping, but couldn’t keep away the feeling of being completely sober. The few drinks with Becca had already worn off and I stood there sober in a crowd of belligerents. It brought down my mood. The acid was supposed to be my magic.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

The rest of the festival went by much like it had last year, but compared to last year I knew my night was nowhere near over. When the drummers dispersed after the bonfire, my group of friends reconvened and drove off to Oh Be Joyful. On our way I took another hit of acid with two other people and made sure not to swallow until they did. The festival was exciting, but this half of our celebration would be empowering. We drove through a creek where the water went up to the windows and then up a hill with a slope that could’ve been ninety degrees. If Mother Nature wanted to be close to people this seemed like the spot. She offered these obstacles but it was almost like she was playing with us. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

My friends set up camp. I could hear and see other camps all over the mountain. Everyone was shouting and getting excited, but personally I wasn’t feeling too good. I think the acid was starting to work. We all went and sat around the fire drinking sake and rum, but no one let me have any on the account that it would fuck me up too much during my first trip. I didn’t mind at first because I thought it was sweet and I was really starting to feel nauseous anyway. Not far into our fire I got up and disappeared into the woods while everyone took the rest of their drugs and continued drinking. My body was shaking and I felt weak, so I listened to Mother Nature and puked on a tree. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

I came back to the fire watching everyone celebrating, while I took things a little slow. Vinotok was almost perfect this year, but it also wasn’t over just yet. There was plenty of time for me to fulfil my pagan daydream. Everyone asked what and how I was feeling, or if I was tripping, but I knew the second hit hadn’t worked either. Apparently this acid won’t work when you swallow it and it definitely doesn’t work when you throw it up. So, instead I drank a little, despite the weary glances from Alex who was sure I was probably
 tripping. A few hours around the 
fire left everyone sufficiently drunk and eventually a few wandered off to other camps. I moved close to my fellow witch and we began to become intrigued by the forest at our backs.
Becca stood me up and we went off to explore. We were tired of the fire and, because it was still Vinotok to us, we decided go off and celebrate the pagan way. We walked through the woods at first with a flashlight, but ditched it before we even lost sight of our fire. We explored the forest by moonlight, and being with your best friend/fellow witch makes it all the more exciting and liberating. I was feeling much better as Becca and I discovered open meadows where we could see each other as easily as if it were day. We danced and shouted in the fields, sometimes climbing up or jumping off rocks.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

 Eventually the rain came, but while everyone else disappeared into their tents, we stayed out and climbed the mountain hills around our camp. We were soaked to our skirts and kept the location of our camp in mind as we climbed higher up a hill overlooking it. By the time we reached the top the rain had stopped and we could see clouds rolling through Oh Be Joyful. We laughed together as witches. This was the moment I had been waiting for. This is the memory and the friend I will never forget as a part of my college experience. In that moment everything I had hoped for during the first few years of college was finally working out and I was finally happy I had seized the moment. We continued dancing and laughing under the moonlight for hours while the rain came and went with the clouds. I felt like I was in The Crucible except no one would ruin this witchcraft fun, until I heard a voice screaming my name from the woods.

        	<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           Reflection- The stories that are in this narrative are all true, but are all from my perspective. This means that while I am recording them as close to memories as I can get, they may not be the entire story, only the part that I am aware of. Each section is a new piece for my frame pack and a new lesson learned, and most of them are a new scar for me.
           <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Growth- What does it mean to come of age? The moments that distinguish the young from the mature? My dad told me to stand back, pay attention, and stay quiet. He haggled with the store clerk for almost half an hour. He slipped fluidly from conversation to bartering to reasoning and then back to money. The midday light streamed into the store through the massive windows that covered one wall of the store.  The store’s shelves were loaded down with the first shipments of summer outdoors gear. Places like this would someday prove to be the bane of my wallet, but for now, it was my dad's mission, not mine.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	My dad refused to give up until he walked away with all the new gear we would need, and more money in his wallet than the manager wanted. Normally people would have just paid what was on the price tag, but not my dad. He was shrewd and cheap that day, and I took note. He wanted a long-term investment without the price tag. That's what he got, and that's what I watched. I always traveled with my wits thanks to that day. I have never had my wallet preyed upon thanks to that lesson.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	This was one of the first lessons I took with me. Even if the lesson did not change what I carried in my bag it did bring me to my bag, and enabled me to first start out in my adventure.
Meals- Hangry is the combination in a disgruntled camper of hunger and anger. This combination can kill a camp trip, and possibly hurt the other outdoorsmen. The power of a good camp cook is greater than just the ability to get the right meal into every one's mouths at the right time; it is the ability to keep the peace within the camp. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I stood at the base of a mountain and argued with an older teen who was almost a man, keeping him calm while the noodles boiled and the chicken simmered. For a fourteen-year-old, this was harder than most of the trek that day. The pack full of food everyone carried needs to get lighter if the mood is going to.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The first time I saw this concept carried out neatly was by a former teacher of mine. She calmed the arguing students and got the cook to finish the meal as swiftly as possible. What made this meal fantastic was the addition of spices from her own personal spice kit. She saved the camp from a long night of heated bickering with that move.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	A spice kit can be the difference between a long, hateful night and pleasant campfire songs in any camp. I always keep my pack stocked with a loaded spice kit now. I have faced down that problem and will never go back to trying to innovate when I could just bring more red pepper. This was one of the first lessons I learned, and the spice kit has been used on nearly all of my future adventures.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rain- Early on I concluded that Hell is not hot, nor is it freezing cold. It is just above freezing, but only just. This means the water is still running but it freezes on you if you try to climb up a hill and get out of the never-ending flood.  But the worst part is that you are alone and lost.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Patagonia is both cruel and beautiful. Heartless yet more full of soul than most of the world I have seen. My pack was still on my back as the water rose up to my chest. My clothes were swiftly soaked through. The world of partly submerged trees blended into one continuous mess. And through it all the rain continued to drive.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The worst part was that we were lost. But the saving grace in this was that we were we and not just I. Pain racked all of us that day, and we hated each other for everything nature was doing to us, but in the end we pulled each other through. We pressed on through with grim determination as the waters rushed around us all day long. Each night we camped on little islands that had been hills just a few days before. Our tents would be encased in ice by morning and the rain was still coming down. The constant downpour made its way into everything that was not properly sealed; that included my sleeping bag. Sleeping in a wet sleeping bag and waking up with ice crusting the outside was a onetime thing for me; once I did it I never forgot.
	To this day I still wrap all my gear in trash bags within my bag. I have forever learned my lesson on that matter. To many Coloradoans my rain preparations may seem to be a little extreme, but that week we wandered in a flooded valley in Patagonia is still fresh in my memories. 
Spare Parts- Goat-heads are a small spiny plant that grow all over bike trails in Utah and Colorado. Nature designed these little bastards to pop the tires of unprepared bikers. The first time I encountered these monstrosities of nature they destroyed my back tire. The crash that followed was spectacular. My bike seat ended up coming apart thanks to that crash. What followed was a very long a winding canyon trail without a seat. After nearly ten miles of not sitting I concluded that I would never bike again without enough spare parts to fix every possible problem. My pack has grease and oil stains on the inside thanks to years of hauling parts and being stuck in bike trailers. I also learned a few things about improvising parts out of popped bike tubes and sticks. However, figuring out how to avoid crashing has still evaded me.
Space- I have never had the need to fill my bag all the way the top. Since I have had to carry my bag on treks, filling it up all the way just meant taking more than I needed. Travelling light was more of a need than a desire. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	After several years of camping, I brought my puppy with me for the first time. He was just over a year old at the time, and not as strong as I thought he was. I set out for just a five-mile hike with plans of camping at a lake. The goal was for the dog to drink from the stream the entire way up, and then he would just share in my dinner. What I had not counted on was the little guy being so afraid of the water that he refused to get close to the creek. Then, about three miles in, he decided that it was time for a nap under a tree.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Since that trip I have always made sure to do two things before camping with my dog. Number one is to leave enough space to carry him if he could not continue and turning back was not an option. The other thing is to always bring a plastic bowl for him to drink out of since he is still afraid of water. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Family- If home is where the heart is then my home has been on my back since I got my bag. The only reason this is possible is thanks to the dozens of people I have traveled with. From family trips up creeks to fish for dinner, to harrowing ridge running to escape storms with my mountaineering partners, there is joy if it is done with family. The greatest adventures can be crushed by strife in a party. The most fearsome of storms can be weathered with the right team.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	In Bolivia I had to carry two of my closest friends when they could not walk for themselves. One was delirious and terrified of everything as her breath came ragged and halting. An allergic reaction had triggered a panic attack. The other was having a negative reaction to the elevation and his brain was failing him. Two more friends were stricken with salmonella while we were in the city, and yet another one fell to a leg injury on a mountain top. I collapsed in the desert near Incan ruins. An airport flooded and trapped us in the Amazon basin. Protests halted busses that were supposed to take us out of cities. There was nothing we could not pull through. We never failed to overcome, and with each trial we grew closer. We found joy in the chaos and pressed through. We survived thanks to each other. There is nothing but warmth that I can carry away from that adventure.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	While I did not change my backpack's load out after this trip in any way, I did change how I went about dealing with the people I was with. Since then, trusting that there is more in an adventure than just me and my bag has been a must. My explorations only grew more challenging as I got older, and the trust that I have shared with people to help me when my I could not help myself proved increasingly important. 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reflection- I have traveled over much more of the world than most men of my age can claim. I have summited peaks in the American Rockies and forded rivers in Patagonian valleys. I have watched protests in Tibet and sunsets in Oregon. Through it all I have carried my backpack. Through the adventure I was shaped into what I am today. Each adventure, each risk, and each move taught me a little more. The first section is also the last one, a reflection. The understanding of what I have become and what I was. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Every new lesson leaves a new scar and a new addition to the contents of my frame pack. It was with me through every step. As it starts to age and the need for a new pack looms on the horizon, I have no idea what to do with it. The straps are beginning to fray and the lining grows stressed. It has been my home, it has carried my heart, and it has suffered more than anything else I own. It has figuratively carried me through my own coming of age story, just as I literally carried it through each step.
