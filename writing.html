     <h2><a id="C1">DEAD DAD WALKING</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Marlida Mear</i></h3>
        
      <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           When I was seven, my dad left forever. My mom didn’t find explaining the concept of death to her only child very appealing, so she told little me that my father had left, permanently. That was that. I thought that I already understood what death meant. I thought that it meant my dad wasn’t coming back, that he was somewhere else where he would be happy.
             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I was eight, my dad came back, and he didn’t look happy. He looked very sad, I thought, as I watched him cross the living room to sit in his large, squishy old armchair, the one my grieving mother still curled up and cried in when she thought I was asleep. I peeked around the corner and stared at my dad sitting in his armchair, his hands resting heavily on the worn arms. He looked sadder than I had ever seen him before he left. I remember his eyes were squeezed shut, and he had a pained, forlorn look on his face, although I didn’t understand why then. I watched, hidden, until suddenly he wasn’t there anymore.
That night, when I told my mom, she kissed me on the forehead and said, “I’m sure you thought you saw him, sweetie, but Daddy’s not coming back.”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I was eleven, my dad came back again. He showed up after school, standing with the rest of the parents. When I left the building with my classmates, he waved. I think he was wary then, not sure of what would happen, but I only saw my dad, waving happily like he had when I was small.
I ran to him, because he was there. My mom was wrong.
“Daddy!” I exclaimed, throwing my arms around him. I felt his arms tighten around me—warm, solid, real.
One of the other parents told my mom, and my hand was forced. I had to tell her the truth.
My mom, torn, put down a deposit for a therapist, who made sure I knew that my father wasn’t coming back.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Yet he did, when I was fourteen. My mom and I were eating dinner, just the two of us, as we had gotten used to. 
We heard the knock at the door, and I froze with a forkful of peas halfway to my mouth. My mom and I made eye contact, silently testing each other to see who would get the door. I knew, somehow, who it would be. I didn’t wait for my mom to ask me to get the door before slowly setting down my fork and moving down the hall.
My dad was there, behind the door. He didn’t look a day older than I remembered him.
“Please, Meg, I need to talk to you.”
I was shaking, I remember, trying not to scream, not to alert Mom. “No. You’re dead,” I finally said, shutting my eyes and the door. When I opened my eyes, he was gone.
I told my mom it had been someone at the wrong address.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I turned seventeen, and my dad came to visit. He came to the door of our new, smaller house in the middle of the birthday party. When he knocked, I opened the door unsuspectingly, expecting birthday guests. I registered surprise, briefly, then dismay, then I shut the door before either of us could say a word.
I wondered if my mother would’ve seen my dad at the door.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I graduated high school with no sign of my dad. I went to college and drove halfway across the country, thinking about what it would’ve been like to have my dad in the car with my mom and I. I moved into my freshman dorm; I thought about the big, comforting hug that was missing after Mom’s, and wondered if he would’ve cried too. 
On the first day of school, I thought I saw my dad, but it turned out to be a professor, who looked at me with a concerned expression. I avoided that professor for months. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I was twenty, I was halfway through the spring semester of my sophomore year. I spent an extraordinary amount of time in the library, and that’s where I was, surrounded by papers and snack wrappers, when I glanced out the window and saw my dad walk by.
I left my piles of homework and hurried out of the library, squinting in the bright sunlight.
“Dad?” I said quietly, but he heard. He turned and walked towards me cautiously. I think he wanted to explain. How does your dead dad come back to life? I discovered it didn’t particularly matter anymore. When he reached me, I hugged him tightly. I was surprised at how much smaller he seemed.
“I’m sorry, Megs,” he said.
I only cried a little bit.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
We reached an agreement. He was there when I graduated college with honors.
He was there when I wrecked my first job interview, and he was there when I got the next one.
He was there on my wedding day, although we both agreed that he couldn’t walk me down the aisle. My mom did, and secretly, I was glad.
He was there when it all fell apart, when I went home to my mom’s house and curled up in the old, well-traveled armchair to cry. 
After Mom finally went to bed after hours of comforting me with hugs and tea, he was there. He gave me a kiss on the forehead, and I felt like I was seven again.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I was thirty-six, my mom died suddenly, unexpectedly, devastatingly. My dad was there then too.
I screamed at him. Terrible, grief-filled, guilt-fueled rage. My mom was gone this time, and I knew it.
“Mom isn’t coming back, is she? Not like you?” I finally asked, quiet, heavy.
He shook his head, looking at me with sorrow.
He was there, every day, for a week.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I turned thirty-seven, my mom had been dead for two months. I missed her hugs more than anything, missed the world we had built over the years. When my father knocked on the door, like always, I had been waiting tensely in the armchair, my foot nervously tapping the floor, a mug of tea ice cold next to me. My cheeks were wet with tears for myself, my dad. My mom. At the knock, I exhaled, letting go of a thousand breaths I hadn’t known I was holding, and opened the door.
“Dad, you’re dead. This needs to stop.”

<h2><a id="C2">It’s 3 A.M.</a></h2>
        <h3><i>Marlena Romero</i></h3>
        
      <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         There’s a shadow lurking in the corner making a gargling noise causing chills down my spine. 
             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I think I’m still in my room. I last remember being there, but I also don’t.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Honey, the car needs an oil change.” I don’t know why I said that. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“That’ll have to wait, babe. I got you a cat! Her name is Birdie.”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I always wanted a cat named Birdie, but did I ever tell Dave? My husband. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He hands me the cat. Beautiful, fluffy, and grey with emerald eyes. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“She likes you, baby! Birdie’s purring!”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
That’s not purring– she’s gargling. I have to watch her now.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Aw! Birdie, my new grandbaby!” Mom is thrilled to have a cat for a granddaughter.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wait, when did Mom get here? I raise my eyes to look at her, but this woman isn’t my mom. I feel like she is, her face is just different... 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chills run through me again when Mom opens her mouth, gargling and standing still as it gets dark around her. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 ***
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Do you think Birdie would like oranges?” Dave has a box full of apples now that we’re outside surrounded by bushes.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I think I was just inside, but now I’m at a tree farm?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There’s that lurking shadow from the corner picking grapes with my brother. My brother?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Jake?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Hey, Jess, I see you brought my favorite niece!” He lowers his eyes to the left of me, “Hi, little miss Birdie, don’t you look pretty in that sundress!”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I notice my hand is holding the tiny hand of a toddler.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“What do you say to Uncle Jake, Birdie?”  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This feels odd.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Thank you!” Birdie giggles and runs off. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jake turns to me as if to say something, but all that’s coming out of him is gargling. The shadow then moves, growing bigger and closer to Jake, absorbing him.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Jake!”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Suddenly, I have Birdie in my arms and I’m sprinting. But I’m not moving! I squeeze Birdie and she disappears from my arms into a tree. My heart’s pounding, I feel it in my throat and stomach. I want to scream, but all I can do is run. But I’m not moving! Sweat beads on my forehead and it’s no longer light out. I cannot see. Something is wrapping around me. As I struggle I jerk forward at a gargling noise directly in my ear. A gasp escapes my mouth and my eyes open. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
***
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I recognize the very dim maroon walls. I’m in my room, in bed. I turn and see my boyfriend, Dave, sleeping. He’s snoring. I glance at the clock worried it’s seven already and I have to get up and get ready for work. I have four more hours to sleep, it’s only 3 A.M.

      <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     “There is a monster in my closet, Mommy.”  Pavonine was huddled under the blankets, swaddling herself in a shell of cloth.  
             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Nobody’s in your closet, little bird.”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her head peeked through the nest of blankets with one beady eye.  “You didn’t check; how do you know?”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Janet Dupree sighed, obeying the ritual that all parents know.  Padding over to the closet she grabbed the handle, and yanked the door open.  Trails of wind caused clothes to flutter and flap.  “See?  No monsters, only clothes and toys.  Now come on, let’s get some sleep.”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She huffed, throwing the covers off, “But there was.”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Janet sighed, “Come on little bird, mommy has to be up by four tomorrow.” She walked over to the bed and started to tuck her in.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“But there was! It was flapping and scratching and whispering my-,”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Pavonine Aves Dupree, go to bed!” Silence reigned supreme as the remnants of Janet’s outburst echoed into memory. Tears welled up in Pavonine’s eyes and one began to roll down her cheek. “Oh honey, I’m sorry. Come on, back to bed you go. We’ll make cookies after school tomorrow.”  
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She sniffed and ran her sleeve over her face, “Promise?”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I promise.”  Janet solemnly extended her pinky, wrapping it around Pavonine’s.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“M’kay.” Janet tucked Pavonine to bed, kissed her forehead, and made a show of checking the closet again, checking it was latched. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Goodnight, my little bird.”  She turned off the lights and shut the bedroom door.   
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Pavonine cast one distrustful eye towards the closet and settled down. The old-fashioned clock on the wall ticked its way towards midnight. Her eyes started to close. Sounds of fluttering and thumping erupted from her closet, and a high chirruping voice called from beyond the door, “Paaavonine.”  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She inhaled about to scream, but the memory of Janet’s anger and refusal to believe stung her. She remained silent and pulled the covers to her chin. Strange lights crept from under the closet and along the floor. Again the voice came, “Paaavonine.” The door began to rattle, shaking in its frame.  The clock struck twelve; a bird erupted from the little door in the clock and signaled midnight.  The lights went out, and the rattling and flapping stopped.  The latch clicked.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Pavonine’s heartbeat thundered in her chest.  It seemed so loud that she began to fear it would drown out the sound of the monster’s approach.  Her fears were not realized.  Even as her heartbeat crashed in her ears, she heard the closet open with an ominous croak. A shadow erupted from the closet to the flutter-flap of wings and raced towards her bed.  
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A terrified squawk escaped Pavonine as she yanked the covers over her head, a futile attempt at protecting herself.  Her terror so intense she couldn’t breathe and… a gentle hand rested on her shivering form, “Pavonine, my baby, my little Cuckoo, it is time to come home.  Come meet your real family. We’ve all been dying to meet you.”

<h2><a id="C4">Their Somatic Blue</a></h2>

      <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Gordon stood over the bed watching Mrs. Stanley sleep. The blackness behind the curtains revealed that it was still dark outside; her husband had already gone out to start the chores on their sheep farm.
             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
You have to do it when she wakes up, said The Voice.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon waited. A faint speck of light touched the black sky, preparing the way for the dawn. Gordon would let the light seep in the room before he made his move. He had to make himself known. He could just sit on the bed, but then she probably wouldn’t recognize him. Should he say something? Only, what would he say to her? What words could he depart with in the little frame of energy he had left?
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The dawn thinned the light blue drapes and painted the room a warm gold. Mrs. Stanley stirred and then her eyes opened. She stared at the wall for a bit, nestled in the covers.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Now, said The Voice.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Gordon pressed onto the bed as firmly as he could.  The comforter molded into the shape of his hand, but Mrs. Stanley didn’t budge. He could sense her eyes dart to the corner of her mind, wondering if she had really felt that. She dismissed it and pressed her cheek further into the pillow. So Gordon sat, putting his whole weight onto the bed.  She raised her head slightly, without turning.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Harry?” she muttered.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Her husband wouldn’t hear her, but that didn’t stop Gordon from doubting himself. He hadn’t prepared for something like this; he didn’t know what to do, or what to say. Harry and Mrs. Stanley had always been good to Gordon and his family. They were the kind of people who shared the burdens of others; they even cared for his boys when he was in the hospital. They still stood by him in his mistakes, and he didn’t want to leave them frightened. Gordon couldn’t help but wonder why he wasn’t spending this time with his family.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The sunlight seeped the curtains nearly a translucent white.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The dawn is coming, Gordon.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There was no backing out now. He could not leave Mrs. Stanley in uncertainty — he had to reveal himself.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He rested his hand on her side, and asked of her what his mother had asked of him years before — before all that pain had eaten her away as well — a request that encompassed the humility and the reverence he desired for his own sheep.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Don’t grieve for me.”
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Mrs. Stanley turned at the sound of his voice. But that world seeped into a gray blur, and Gordon watched the translucent curtains settle back into their somatic blue.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    They left, but the mongrel stayed. And part of me died. 
             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
* * * * *
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I peeked through my binoculars which strove desperately to find light within my dimly lit second-story bedroom. No sign of the monster. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Oh come on! Don’t judge me just yet. I think I deserve some credit. I tried. I tried to ignore and endure the horrendous howling, the enraging ruckus, the disgusting dissonance; but the bone-crunching cacophony of the beast’s vocal chords ravaged the remaining piece of emotional peace quivering in my soul. My patience regarding that dog was as thin as a handkerchief. I had to dispose of this mutt before my brain started to pulsate endlessly from pounding eardrums and lack of sleep. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But, I did try. I perpetually strove to convince the Petersons to affix the boisterous beagle with a muzzle or imprison it in the house or, in a perfect world, sell the creature and buy a cat; but, I never did figure out how to sign the word “muzzle” or “imprison” or “creature.” The fact is, the couple literally turned deaf ears to their dog, and the dog knew it. Now, with the Petersons gone once again on their annual three-day catfishing trip to Louisiana’s Red River, I had a full weekend to frame the dog-sitter for the random and tragic disappearance of the unfortunate puppy.
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Speaking of the eleven-year-old Girl Scout, her skinny figure bounced into view of my binoculars, and I flinched at the all-too-familiar raspy welcome she received from the Peterson household. The girl looked so innocent. Perfect. Imagine how her still pimple-free, distressed forehead would wrinkle up like the folds in her skirt when she found the dog missing, and imagine the silence! I love the silence. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
As the girl approached the door to the house, I rolled up my dusty window and casually inquired, “Hi Madi, how are you doing?”
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“I’m doing super! I get to take care of the Peterson’s dog this weekend,” she proclaimed. I will never understand that girl’s enthusiasm for the grotesque. 
 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Ah, so I heard. How is Chopstick doing?” What kind of a mismatched, absurd name is “Chopstick” for a beagle anyways?! You can’t even do anything with one stupid chopstick.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 “He’s good. I left him in the backyard earlier today so he could play with the new toy I bought him. Now I’m going to put him back inside for the night.” Fabulous. The toy probably squeals a high-pitched wail whenever the dog clamps down on its cheap rubber.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Well isn’t that considerate of you.” If only it could stay outside!
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Madi quickly rescued the dog from the back yard then skipped away with her braids hopping behind her. Thus, my plan commenced. While I waited for the sun to fully set, I typed up the ad I concocted for the newspaper.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Going Catfishing?<br />
I have some stinkbait you can have for free.<br />

They left, but the mongrel stayed ...very quiet.

    THollis was nothing if not an inferno. When he first kissed me, his mouth tasted like old fire and metal spoons, like he had fired a bullet through the roof of his mouth and its flavor had become part of his essence. A bullet lodged in the brain would have explained some of his crazy. Hollis was a fire cracker trapped in a meat suit. The flames were eating him up from inside, starting low in his belly, weaving their scorching hands under his lungs and around his ribs, coiling their trembling fingers around his heart. I’d like to think that when he pushed needles into his arm and poured alcohol down his throat he was just trying to put out the flame, stop the burning. I once came across him standing in his living room, pressing all of his weight onto the glass of his window, ten stories up. His hands were tensed next to his head, knuckles white and bloodless. The way he was leaning his whole self into the window, pushing it with his hands, I think maybe he wanted the glass to shatter, wanted to know the adrenaline of watching the ground rise up to claim him as he dove for it. I had rested a hand on his back, felt his skin, just a little too hot, felt the frantic pounding of his heart. He had turned, pressed his mouth to mine. I was terrified of him then, scared that the flames would jump from his tongue to mine, start me burning too.  He made burning alive look like ecstasy. I was terrified by how much I wanted it.
